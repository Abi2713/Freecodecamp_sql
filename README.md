# SQL 
### What is a Database (DB)?
 Any collection of related information
    1. Phone Book
    2. Shopping list
    3. Todo list
    4. Your 5 best friends 
    5. Facebook's user base, etc..
- Database can be stored in different ways
    1. On paper
    2. In your mind
    3. On a computer
    4. This Notion note on SQL itself
    5. Comment section
    
#  Database Management System (DBMS) : 
- A special software program that helps users to create and manage a database
    - makes its easy to manage large amount of information
    - handles security
    - backups
    - importing/exporting data
    - concurrency - In a database management system (DBMS), concurrency control manages simultaneous access to a database.
    - Interacts with software application
        - Programming languages

## CRUD

- CRUD (CREATE, READ/RETRIEVE, UPDATE, DELETE) is use to perform following functionalities - to create a database, read or retrieve informations from database, update the existing information database and delete the information in database.
- These are core 4 operations or functionalities in DBMS.

## Two Types of Databases

1. Relational databases (SQL)
    - Organize data into one or more tables
        - Each table has columns and rows
        - A unique key identifies each row

  2.  Non-Relational (no-SQL / not just SQL)

- Organize data in anything but a traditional table
    - Key-value stores
    - Documents(JSON, XML, etc.)
    - Graphs
    - Flexible table

## 1. Relational Databases (SQL)

- Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
    - Example: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, etc.
- Structured Query Language
    - Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
    - Used to perform 4 core operations i.e. CRUD operations, as well as other administrative tasks(user management, security, backups, etc.).
    - Used to define tables and structures
    - SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification
- Example of Relational Database i.e. SQL  
    -  Below ID and Username is unique

## 2. Non-Relational Databases (noSQL, not just SQL)

- Non-Relational Database management System (NRDBMS)
    - Helps users to create and maintain a non-relational database
        - Example: MongoDB, DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra, Firebase, etc.
- Implementation specific
    - Any non-relational databases falls under this category, so there is no set of language standard.
    - Most NRDBMS will implement their own language for performing CRUD and administrative operations on databases.
- Example of Non-Relational Databases (noSQL, not just SQL) -

### Database Queries

- Queries are requests made to the database management system for specific information
- As database's structure become more and more complex, it becomes more difficult to get the specific pieces of information we want.
- A google search is a query

# Tables & Keys
![capture4 PNG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67586773/142226373-9de485ff-6f1f-4931-956e-588713de1074.png)

All tables in Relational Databases we have 2 things Rows & Columns
 -  Row or horizontal entry represents individual entry i.e. row represents single student (in above example)  eg. 1(student id), Jack(student name), biology(major)
 -  Column or vertical entry represents single attribute  eg. major, name, student_id

# Primary Key
 - Whenever we are creating table in Relational Databases we always have 1 very special column which is called primary key.
 
 ![Capture5 PNG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67586773/142227085-7f15c7f9-4910-4fbc-9378-e89e086bae68.png)
 
  - Primary key is a attribute which uniquely defines row in database.
  - Primary key will always unique for each rows in table even if all of attribute will same in row.
  - Primary key can be anything it can be a number or it can be string of text but it has uniquely identify the specific row.
  
 ### Types of Primary key 
 
  1. **Surrogate key** - Surrogate key is a key which has no mapping to anything in real world.
     - In below table just a random number assign to employee and that necessarily mean anything.
   
   ![Capture6 PNG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67586773/142614438-7d3ab538-e6bf-450b-9d5f-734f690f81e7.png)

   2. **Natural Key** - Natural key is a key which has mapping to real world.
      - In below table emp_ssn ( social sequrity number is the number used in USA to identify each citizens uniquely)
      
   ![captur7 PNG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67586773/142733871-452fe316-fce8-4975-aba9-deff0b362066.png)

   3. **Foreign Key** - Foreign key is an attribute in table that links us to another table in database. Or Foreign key is primary key of linked table.
      - In below table i.e. Employee table, branch_id is foreign key which linked with another table i.e. Branch table. And mgr_is also a foreign key.
      
   ![Capture8 PNG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67586773/142733953-234dd158-8610-48ba-b4a4-73642ff809f2.png)

      - One table can have more than one foreign key.
      - In below table super_id (supervisor id) is also a foreign key that links employee table itself. (eg. Jan Levinson is supervisor of Michael Scott & Josh Porter)


 **Composite Key** - Composite key is a candidate key that consists of two or  more attributes(table columns) that together identify an entity occurrence(table row).
 - In below table, there are 2 primary keys (branch_id, supplier_name) and that are composite keys.
 - We need composite key because here, supplier_name or  branch_id doesn't uniquely identify row by itslef and they are repeating. Only together they can identify row.
 - Eg. Hammer Mill supply Paper to branch_id 2 & 3. Uni-ball supply Writing Utensils to branch_id 2 & 3.
 
 ![Capture11 PNG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67586773/142803624-ddfdf5ce-dc26-4316-9231-86676ed27f60.png)
 
 - In below example, in Works_With table, both emp_id & client_id are composite key and also foreign key helps us to link relationship between Employee table and Client table.
 - Eg, emp_id 101 (i.e. Michael Scott) sold paper(suppose) to client_id 401 (i.e. Lackawana Country) in branch_id 2 (i.e. Scranton Branch) worth $2,67,000 .

# What is SQL ?
### SQL or Structured Query Language is a standard language for relational database management system.
 - You can use SQL to get the RDBMS to do things for you
    - Create, retrieve/read, update & delete data
    - Create & manage databases
    - Design & create database tables
    - Perform administration tasks(security, user management, import/export, etc.
    
 - SQL implementations vary between systems
     - Not all RDBMS' follow the SQL standard to a 'T'
     - The concepts are the same but the implementation may vary
    
 - SQL is usually a hybrid language, it's basically 4 types of language in one
 
     1. Data Query Language (DQL)
         - Used to query the database for information.
         - Get information that is already stored there

     2. Data Definition Language (DDL)
         - Used for defining databases schemas.

     3. Data Control Language (DCL)
         - Used for controlling access to the data in the database.
         - User & permission management

     4. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
         - Used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the database.
     
   ### Queries

  - A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS (written is SQL) that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you
    - Tons of data in a DB
    - Often hidden i a complex schema
    - Goal is to only get the data you need
    - And any Query in SQL ends with ;
    
    
    ```sql
     SELECT employee.name, employee.age
     FROM employee
     WHERE employee.salary > 300000;
     ```

  ### **Installation**

- Install MySQL community server OR Xampp Server
- Install PopSQL visualizing queries.

 ## Datatypes (CORE)

1. INT             - Whole Numbers
2. DECIMAL(M,N)    - Decimal Numbers - Exact value  Eg., DECIMAL(10,4) 
3. VARCHAR(100)      - String of text of length 100 here.
4. BLOB            - Binary Large Object, Stores large data
5. DATE            - 'YYYY-MM-DD'
6. TIMESTAMP       - 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' - used for recording.

 ### Creating Database

- You can either create database using MySQL Community Server CLI
    - Syntax: create database databaseName;
    
 ![Capture13 PNG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67586773/147811977-30e5ba9a-1109-414c-8cb6-952c234eb9e4.png)
    
- or using phpmyadmin panel.
     
### Creating table

![Capture14 PNG](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67586773/147812006-6d33cec0-1cbb-4c22-8421-862d4778ee6d.png)

```sql
CREATE TABLE student(

student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,

names VARCHAR(20),

major VARCHAR(20)

-- PRIMARY KEY(student_id)  // comment in SQL

);
```

### Describing The Table

- Syntax: DESCRIBE tableName;
    
    ```sql
     DESCRIBE student;
    ```
    

### Delete The Table

- Syntax: DROP Table tableName;
    
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE student;
    ```   
## SELECT Statement:

- Grab all the information from the table.
- Syntax: SELECT * FROM table_name;
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM student;
    ```
    

### ALTER The Table

- Syntax: ALTER Table tableName ADD column_name datatype( );    (Suppose we want to add cgpa column)
    
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE student ADD cgpa DECIMAL(3,2);
    ```
    
    - OR you can also drop table
    
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN cgpa;
    ```
    
# Inserting Data

- Syntax: INSERT INTO tab_name VALUES();
    
    
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'Biology');
    INSERT INTO student VALUES(2, 'Kate', 'Sociology');
    ```
    

>Rows affected 1 (You'll see this message after inserting above information) 

### *You can specify what you want to insert specifically into the table. See below example,*

- Suppose a student don't have major then we can  modify our INSERT Statement as follow:
    
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(3, 'Claire');
    ```
    

>Now If we see the Claire's major, then it'll show **NULL**
    
 # Constraints

- SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table.
- NOT NULL,  UNIQUE

```sql
CREATE TABLE student(

student_id INT,
names VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- i.e. you cannot insert for **name** column
major VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,  -- i.e. major coloumn must be unique for each row in this table
PRIMARY KEY(student_id)  // comment in SQL

);

SELECT * FROM student;

INSERT INTO student VALUES(1, 'Jack', 'Biology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(2, 'Kate', 'Sociology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(3, NULL, 'Chemistry');   -- it'll throw error as we've mentioned that name van't be NULL
INSERT INTO student VALUES(4, 'Jack', 'Biology');  -- it'll throw error - **Duplicate entry 'Biology' for key 'major'** as we've mentioned major column must be Unique for each row
INSERT INTO student VALUES(5, 'Mike', 'Computer Science');
```

- DEFAULT

```sql
CREATE TABLE student(

student_id INT,
names VARCHAR(20) ,
major VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'undecided', 
PRIMARY KEY(student_id) 

);

SELECT * FROM student;

INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(1, 'Jack');   -- i.e now if you'll see Jack's major for student_id:1, it'll show **undecided**
INSERT INTO student VALUES(2, 'Kate', 'Sociology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(3, 'Claire', 'Chemistry');   
INSERT INTO student VALUES(4, 'Jack', 'Biology');
INSERT INTO student VALUES(5, 'Mike', 'Computer Science');
```
- AUTO_INCREMENT (increment primary key automatically in this case student_id)

```sql
CREATE TABLE student(

student_id INT,
names VARCHAR(20) AUTO_INCREMENT,  
major VARCHAR(20), 
PRIMARY KEY(student_id) 

);

SELECT * FROM student;

INSERT INTO student(name, major) VALUES('Jack', 'Biology');   
INSERT INTO student(name, major) VALUES('Claire', 'Chemistry');   
INSERT INTO student(name, major) VALUES('Jack', 'Biology');
INSERT INTO student(name, major) VALUES('Mike', 'Computer Science');

> you'll see auto-increment of student-id
```
# Update & Delete

## UPDATE

- Suppose we have to set same major i.e. '**bio**' to all students :

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;

UPDATE student
SET major = 'Bio';
```

- Suppose we have to set major i.e. '**bio**' where major is 'biology':

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;

UPDATE student
SET major = 'Bio'
WHERE major = 'biology';

-- OR

UPDATE student
SET major = 'Comp Sci.'
WHERE major = 'Computer Science';
```

SET major = 'Bio'
WHERE student_id = 4;
```

- Suppose we have to set major to 'Biochemistry' where major is 'bio' or 'chemistry'

- Suppose we have to change both name and major to name = 'Tom' and major = 'undecided' at student_id = 1 :

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;

UPDATE student
SET name = 'Tom', major = 'undecided'
WHERE student_id = 1;
```
## DELETE

- **Delete all the rows:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;

DELETE FROM student;
```
- Delete specific row:

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;

DELETE FROM student
WHERE student_id = 5;
```
1. Suppose we have to delete specifically:

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;

DELETE FROM student
WHERE name = 'Tom' AND major = 'undecided'
```
2. Suppose you want to grab name and major both from table:

SELECT name, major
FROM student;

-- OR (If we have many tables then,)
```sql
SELECT student.name, student.major
FROM student;
```
3. Suppose you want to grab name and major both from table and order by **alphabetically**(name):

```sql
SELECT student.name, student.major
FROM student
ORDER BY name;
```
4. Suppose you want to grab all information from table in descending or ascending order of student_id:

```sql
-- DESCENDING ORDER

SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY student_id DESC;

-- ASCENDING ORDER

SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY student_id ASC;
```

5. Suppose you want to grab all information from table in alphabetical order of major and student_id:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY major, student_id;
```
5.1. Suppose you want to grab all information from table in alphabetical order of major and student_id (in descending order):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY major, student_id DESC;
```
### LIMIT

- If you want to get limited number of rows then you can use **LIMIT** keyword.
6. Suppose you want to grab all information till 2 rows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT 2;
```

 6.1. Suppose you want to grab all information till 2 rows and also by descending order of student_id:
 
 ```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
ORDER BY student_id DESC
LIMIT 2;
 ```
 
 7. Suppose you want to grab name and major from table where major = 'Chemistry' OR major='Biology':

```sql
SELECT name, major
FROM student
WHERE major = 'Chemistry' OR major = 'Biology';
```
8. Suppose you want to grab all information where major is not equal (<>) to 'Chemistry':

```sql
SELECT name, major
FROM student
WHERE major <> 'Chemistry';
```
9. Suppose you want to grab all information where student_id is less than (<) 3:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE student_id < 3;
```
10. Suppose you want to grab all information where student_id is less than (<) 3 and name is not equal (<>) to 'Jack':

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE student_id < 3 AND name <> 'Jack';
```
11. Suppose you want to grab all information where names are equal to Claire, Kate & Mike:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE name IN ('Claire','Kate','Mike');
```

12. Suppose you want to grab all information where majors are equal to Biology & Chemistry and student_id > 2:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE major IN ('Biology', 'Chemistry') AND student_id > 2;
```

* Employee Table - 

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
	emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(40),
	last_name VARCHAR(40),
	bith_day DATE,
	sex VARCHAR(1),
	salary INT,
	super_id INT,
	branch_id INT
);
```

* Branch Table - 

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch (
	branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	branch_name VARCHAR(40),
	mgr_id INT,
	mgr_start_date DATE, 
	FOREIGN KEY(mgr_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE SET NULL 
);
```
* As we need to set the super_id and branch_id of the employee table as Foreign key in the employee table &  branch table and employee have not been created yet. We can achieve it by following queries

```sql
ALTER TABLE employee
ADD FOREIGN KEY(branch_id)
REFERENCES branch(branch_id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

ALTER TABLE employee
ADD FOREIGN KEY(super_id),
REFERENCES employee(emp_id)
ON DELETE SET NULL; 
```


* Client Table - 

```sql
CREATE TABLE client (
	client_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	client_name VARCHAR (40),
	branch_id VARCHAR(40),
  FOREIGN KEY (branch_id) REFERENCES branch(branch_id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
);
```

* Works_With Table - 

```sql
CREATE TABLE client (
	client_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	client_name VARCHAR (40),
	branch_id VARCHAR(40),
  FOREIGN KEY (branch_id) REFERENCES branch(branch_id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
);
```
* Branch Supplier Table - 

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch_supplier (
	branch_id INT,
	supplier_name VARCHAR(40),
	supply_type VARCHAR(40),
  FOREIGN KEY(branch_id, supplier_name), // supplier_name is not foreign key but it is composite key
  FOREIGN KEY (branch_id) REFERENCES branch(branch_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
);
```
### Inserting information into tables now:

* Employee and Branch Table

```sql

-- Corporate 
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(100, 'David', 'Wallace', '1967-11-17', 'M',250000,ES9 NULL, NULL);

// We've set branch_id as NULL because corporate branch have not been creaated yet
// So, we're inserting values into branch table

INSERT INTO branch VALUES(1, 'Corporate', 100, '2006-02-09');

UPDATE employee 
SET branch_id = 1
WHERE emp_id = 100;

## Now to check whether we have perfectly added information into table or not

```sql
-- Employee table
Select * from employee;

-- Branch table
Select * from branch;

-- Client table
Select * from client;

-- Works_With table
Select * from works_with;

-- Branch Supplier table
Select * from branch_supplier; 
```
